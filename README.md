## What is this?
This is a basic template for rest api with authentication features using express and mongoDB. 
## What can you use it for?
You can use this template to either learn express from start or just use it as jump start. Feel free to copy or fork it.
## What we used?
* We used node.js's express library as our main library. Whole rest functionality comes from here.
* We used MongoDB as database but you can change this to whatever you want.
* We used Json Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
* We used Apidoc as main documentation tool, you can ignore it but we highly recommend to use it.
* We used eslint with airbnb settings for cleaner code, highly recommend to use it but you can ignore it too. (Can be tricky to get used to it, even to set it up)
* We included Mail sender and Photo uploder functionalty if needed.
